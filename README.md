# Jinni
Jinni is the first professional non-toy Arabic Programming Language, it supports English keywords as well and is compatible with Web APIs. It has a card-based Google-keep-like IDE which make it easy and practical to write code on the go.

# Note
The original IDE had an integrated version control system. Since I added support for integration with Git, I'm currently moving all the projects related to Jinni to GitHub.
