# Jinni
Jinni is the first professional non-toy Arabic Programming Language, it supports English keywords as well, and is compatible with Web APIs. It has a card-based Google-keep-like IDE which make it easy and practical to write code on the go.

*Jinni is the [Aladdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin) creature that comes out from the magic lamp upon request and has tho power to grant wishes.*
*A [Jinni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn) is neither an angel nor a demon, something in between, it can be good or evil, depending on how you handle it.*

# Note
The original IDE had an integrated version control system. Since I added support for integration with Git, I'm currently moving all projects related to Jinni to GitHub.
