Jinni allows you to write code using the familiar and intuitive Arabic script, breaking down the language barrier that has long plagued developers. No more struggling to translate your thoughts into a foreign syntax – with Jinni, your creativity flows seamlessly from your mind to the screen.

But the true magic lies in the Jinni IDE, which takes inspiration from the beloved Google Keep. Imagine a workspace where your code lives on virtual "cards," accessible from any device, anywhere. Whether you're on your desktop, your tablet, or even your smartphone, your projects are always at your fingertips, ready to be refined and expanded with a few taps or swipes.

The beauty of this system lies in its simplicity and flexibility. Tired of being chained to a single workstation? Jinni liberates you, allowing you to pick up where you left off, no matter where you are. Collaborate with your team in real-time, share snippets of code, and watch your project come to life across multiple screens – all with the intuitive ease of a note-taking app.

But don't be fooled by its user-friendly interface; Jinni packs a powerful punch under the hood. Boasting cutting-edge compilers, lightning-fast execution, and seamless integration with a wide range of platforms and libraries, this language is poised to redefine the boundaries of what's possible in the world of software development.

Whether you're a seasoned programmer or a budding coder, Jinni is the tool you've been waiting for. Embrace the future of programming, where your native language and your digital workspace converge to unleash your full creative potential. Get ready to experience the joy of coding like never before with Jinni – the programming language that speaks your language.

# Note
The original IDE had an integrated version control system. Since I added support for integration with Git, I'm currently moving all projects related to Jinni to GitHub.
